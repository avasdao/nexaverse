# Configuration for routing activity.

# Network ID; this is 'nexaverse' for mainnet, 'buckhead' or 'peachtree' for testnet.
#netid=nexaverse

# Minimum number of routers nexaverse will attempt to maintain connections to.
#min-connections=4

# Maximum number (hard limit) of routers nexaverse will be connected to at any time.
#max-connections=6

# Optional directory for containing nexaverse runtime data. This includes generated
# private keys.

# The number of threads available for performing cryptographic functions.
# The minimum is one thread, but network performance may increase with more.
# threads. Should not exceed the number of logical CPU cores.
# 0 means use the number of logical CPU cores detected at startup.

[network]
# Network settings
# Snapp settings


# Public key of a router which will act as a pinned first-hop. This may be used to
# provide a trusted router (consider that you are not fully anonymous with your
# first hop).
#strict-connect=

# The private key to persist address with. If not specified the address will be
# ephemeral.
#keyfile=

# Set the endpoint authentication mechanism.
# none/whitelist/lmq/file
#auth=

# lmq endpoint to talk to for authenticating new sessions
# ipc:///var/lib/nexaverse/auth.socket
# tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
#auth-lmq=

# lmq function to call for authenticating new sessions
# llarp.auth
#auth-lmq-method=llarp.auth

# manually add a remote endpoint by .nexa address to the access whitelist
#auth-whitelist=

# Read auth tokens from file to accept endpoint auth
# Can be provided multiple times
#auth-file=

# How to interpret the contents of an auth file.
# Possible values: hashes, plaintext
#auth-file-type=

# Manually add a static auth code to accept for endpoint auth
# Can be provided multiple times
#auth-static=

# Determines whether we will publish our snapp's introset to the DHT.
#reachable=1

# Number of hops in a path. Min 1, max 8.

# Number of paths to maintain at any given time.

# Whether or not we should act as an exit node. Beware that this increases demand
# on the server and may pose liability concerns. Enable at your own risk.
#exit=0

# When in exit mode announce we allow a private range in our introsetexmaple:
# owned-range=10.0.0.0/24
#owned-range=

# List of ip traffic whitelist, anything not specified will be dropped by us.examples:
# tcp for all tcp traffic regardless of port
# 0x69 for all packets using ip protocol 0x69udp/53 for udp port 53
# tcp/smtp for smtp port
#traffic-whitelist=

# Specify a `.nexa` address and an optional ip range to use as an exit broker.
# Example:
# exit-node=whatever.nexa # maps all exit traffic to whatever.nexa
# exit-node=stuff.nexa:100.0.0.0/24 # maps 100.0.0.0/24 to stuff.nexa
#exit-node=

# Specify an optional authentication code required to use a non-public exit node.
# For example:
#     exit-auth=myfavouriteexit.nexa:abc
# uses the authentication code `abc` whenever myfavouriteexit.nexa is accessed.
# Can be specified multiple times to store codes for different exit nodes.
#exit-auth=

# Enable / disable automatic route configuration.
# When this is enabled and an exit is used Lokinet will automatically configure operating system routes to route traffic through the exit node.
# This is enabled by default, but can be disabled to perform advanced exit routing configuration manually.
#auto-routing=1

# Enable / disable route configuration blackholes.
# When enabled nexaverse will drop ip4 and ip6 not included in exit config.
# Enabled by default.

# Interface name for nexaverse traffic. If unset nexaverse will look for a free name
# nexaverseN, starting at 0 (e.g. nexaverse0, nexaverse1, ...).
#ifname=

# Local IP and range for nexaverse traffic. For example, 172.16.0.1/16 to use
# 172.16.0.1 for this machine and 172.16.x.y for remote peers. If omitted then
# nexaverse will attempt to find an unused private range.
#ifaddr=

# For all ipv6 exit traffic you will use this as the base address bitwised or'd with the v4 address in use.
# To disable ipv6 set this to an empty value.
# !!! WARNING !!! Disabling ipv6 tunneling when you have ipv6 routes WILL lead to de-anonymization as nexaverse will no longer carry your ipv6 traffic.
#ip6-range=fd00::

# Map a remote `.nexa` address to always use a fixed local IP. For example:
#     mapaddr=whatever.nexa:172.16.0.10
# maps `whatever.nexa` to `172.16.0.10` instead of using the next available IP.
# The given IP address must be inside the range configured by ifaddr=
#mapaddr=

# Adds a nexaverse relay `.snode` address to the list of relays to avoid when
# building paths. Can be specified multiple times.

[paths]
# path selection algorithm options


# Netmask for router path selection; each router must be from a distinct IP subnet of the given size.
# E.g. 16 ensures that all routers are using distinct /16 IP addresses.
#unique-range-size=32


[dns]
# DNS configuration


# Upstream resolver(s) to use as fallback for non-nexa addresses.
# Multiple values accepted.
#upstream=9.9.9.10

# Address to bind to for handling DNS requests.
#bind=127.0.0.1:953

# Add a hosts file to the dns resolver
# For use with client side dns filtering
#add-hosts=

# Can be uncommented and set to 1 to disable resolvconf configuration of nexaverse DNS.
# (This is not used directly by nexaverse itself, but by the nexaverse init scripts
# on systems which use resolveconf)
#no-resolvconf=


[bind]
# This section specifies network interface names and/or IPs as keys, and
# ports as values to control the address(es) on which Lokinet listens for
# incoming data.
#
# Examples:
#
#     eth0=1090
#     0.0.0.0=1090
#     1.2.3.4=1090
#
# The first bind to port 1090 on the network interface 'eth0'; the second binds
# to port 1090 on all local network interfaces; and the third example binds to
# port 1090 on the given IP address.
#
# If a private range IP address (or an interface with a private IP) is given, or
# if the 0.0.0.0 all-address IP is given then you must also specify the
# public-ip= and public-port= settings in the [router] section with a public
# address at which this router can be reached.
# Typically this section can be left blank: if no inbound bind addresses are
# configured then nexaverse will search for a local network interface with a public
# IP address and use that (with port 1090).


# Specify a source port for **outgoing** Lokinet traffic, for example if you want to
# set up custom firewall rules based on the originating port. Typically this should
# be left unset to automatically choose random source ports.
#*=0


[api]
# JSON API settings


# Determines whether or not the LMQ JSON API is enabled. Defaults
#enabled=1

# IP address and port to bind to.
# Recommend localhost-only for security purposes.
#bind=tcp://127.0.0.1:1190


[bootstrap]
# Configure nodes that will bootstrap us onto the network


# Whether or not to run as a seed node. We will not have any bootstrap routers configured.
#seed-node=0

# Specify a bootstrap file containing a signed RouterContact of a service node
# which can act as a bootstrap. Can be specified multiple times.
#add-node=


[logging]
# logging settings


# Log type (format). Valid options are:
#   file - plaintext formatting
#   syslog - logs directed to syslog
#type=file

# Minimum log level to print. Logging below this level will be ignored.
# Valid log levels, in ascending order, are:
#   trace
#   debug
#   info
#   warn
#   error
#level=warn

# When using type=file this is the output filename. If given the value 'stdout' or
# left empty then logging is printed as standard output rather than written to a
# file.
#file=
