## Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some of the most commonly asked questions about the Nexaverse.

### Why are you using PoW and not PoS to produce a Space's assets?

Although we're now post "Merge", it is our experience that PoW will offer a greater defense against the ever fearful [__Howey Test__](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp); and give our user community a greater assurance when creating and managing their token economies.
