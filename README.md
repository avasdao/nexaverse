## Use Cases

_TBD_


## Team

Ava's DAO is lead by [__0xShomari__](https://twitter.com/0xShomari).

We aim to have the support of the Georgia Tech's [__Advanced Technology Development Center__](https://atdc.org/) in HOTlanta.


## Go-To-Market Strategy

_TBD_


## Technologies Used

Our team has integrated over a dozen Web3 innovations into our all-NEW Nexaverse mobile app. Below we detail some of our most noteworthy implementations ðŸ‘‡

### Filecoin

We're using the Filecoin system via [__Fleek__](https://fleek.co/) to store media for our user's Spaces.

__You can view our implementation in the following source code:__

- `/mobile/screens/Spaces.js` _(line ##)_

### Moralis

We're using the [__Moralis Web3 APIs__](https://v1docs.moralis.io/moralis-dapp/web3-api) to power ALL of our blockchain communications. Nexaverse currently supports both the Mainnet and Testnet for the following blockchains:

1. Polygon _(MATIC)_
2. Ethereum _(ETH)_
3. Avalanche _(AVAX)_
4. Binance _(BSC)_

Our team will soon be looking to install a __`parse-server`__ and make the migration to a [__self-hosted Moralis server__](https://docs.moralis.io/docs/v1-server-self-hosting).

__You can view our implementation in the following source code:__

- [`/mobile/package.json`](https://github.com/avasdao/nexaverse/blob/feba822624204eb796c40bb425bc34716fe02d58/mobile/package.json#L29) _(line 29)_
- `/mobile/src/App.js` _(line ##)_


### Polygon

We've chosen Polygon as our default blockchain for its:

- Speed to finality
- Scalability
- Low gas fees
- Security
- Developer support

> ___Please Note:__ We're currently considering migrating to a [__Polygon Supernet__](https://polygon.technology/supernets/), which would allow our team even greater control of our back-end infrastructure & application security._

__You can view our implementation in the following source code:__

- [`/contracts/Spaces.sol`](https://github.com/avasdao/nexaverse/blob/master/contracts/Spaces.sol)
- `/mobile/screens/Spaces.js` _(line ##)_

### Valist

We're using the Filecoin system via [__Fleek__](https://fleek.co/) to store media for our user's Spaces.

__You can view our implementation in the following source code:__

### XMTP

We're using the Filecoin system via [__Fleek__](https://fleek.co/) to store media for our user's Spaces.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some of the most commonly asked questions about the Nexaverse.

### Why are you using PoW and not PoS to produce a Space's assets?

Although we're now post "Merge", it is our experience that PoW will offer a greater defense against the ever fearful [__Howey Test__](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp); and give our user community a greater assurance when creating and managing their crypto economies.

### What is 0xNEX?

__0xNEX__ is the base coin/asset of the Nexaverse. This coin is bridged from the [__Nexa blockchain__](https://www.nexa.org/) via the [__Nexa Exchange__](https://nexa.exchange). __$NEX__ is the native coin/asset of Nexa.

_1 0xNEX = 1 $NEX_

### What is the USD value of 1 (One) 0xNEX coin?

At the time of this writing, 0xNEX has no face value, as there are currently NO exchanges supporting this asset.
