## Application-specific Gas Fees

Gas fees are dynamically adjusted based on the application and the current load on the network.

> It is highly encouraged to migrate to a private Subnet in the case of consistently high gas fees. The Nexaverse Migration Toolkit (NMT) makes the process effortless for both developers and users.
