# Gaming Spaces

Creating a game is a great way to earn residual income in the Nexaverse.

Games can be played on your TV, while using your mobile device as a controller. Visit [nexaverse.net](https://nexaverse.net) using your smart TV web browser.

## Revenue

For every $1.00 that is earned by the game:
- 30% is paid to Investors _(aka Liquidity Providers)_
- 60% is paid to the Creators
- 10% is held by the Nexaverse Treasury
