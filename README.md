## Introduction

Nexaverse lives as a side-chain to a bleeding-edge UTXO blockchain called [__Nexa__](https://www.nexa.org/). Together they form a bond that covers the best of both blockchain universes; providing __Users__, __BUIDLers__ and __Investors__ with the luxury of choice!

## Technologies Used

We've implemented over a dozen innovations into the Nexaverse mobile app. The following notable features are:

### Moralis

We're using the Moralis Web3 APIs to power ALL of our blockchain communications.

Our team will soon be looking to install a `parse-server` and make the migration to [__self-hosting__](https://docs.moralis.io/docs/v1-server-self-hosting).

__You can see our integration in the following source code:__

- [`/mobile/package.json`](https://github.com/avasdao/nexaverse/blob/feba822624204eb796c40bb425bc34716fe02d58/mobile/package.json#L29)
- `/mobile/src/App.js`


### Filecoin

We're using the Filecoin system via [__Fleek__](https://fleek.co/) to store media for our user's Spaces.

__You can see our integration in the following source code:__

- `/mobile/screens/Spaces.js`

### Polygon

## Frequently Asked Questions

Here are some of the most commonly asked questions about the Nexaverse.

### Why are you using PoW and not PoS to produce a Space's assets?

Although we're now post "Merge", it is our experience that PoW will offer a greater defense against the ever fearful [__Howey Test__](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp); and give our user community a greater assurance when creating and managing their token economies.

### What is the USD value of 1 NEX coin?

At the time of this writing, NEX has no face value, as there are currently NO exchanges supporting the coin.
